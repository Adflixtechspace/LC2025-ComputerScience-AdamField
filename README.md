# LC2025-ComputerScience-AdamField

This repository contains my projects and coding work from the **2025 Leaving Certificate Computer Science course**.  
It includes my 30% project as well as a range of coding challenges, written mainly in **Python** and **HTML/CSS**.  

## Highlights
- Achieved a **H2 grade** in Computer Science (final exam 2025).
